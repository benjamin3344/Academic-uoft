The homepage of ZJUDancer in YOUKU is [here](https://i.youku.com/u/UMjAyMzAwNjM2?spm=a2h0k.11417342.soresults.dname). There includes five groups: Mechanical group, Electrical group, Gait group, Vision group and Algorithm group. I am in the Gait group whose responsibility is to calibrate the exterior parameters of the soccer robots, to design new postures and to check parameters to make sure that robots could fulfill the designated movements accurately.
