abstract = "This thesis topic is Design of the tip control of the flexible beam driven by linear motor based on vibration modal analysis. With the flexible parts more and more applied in the field of industry, medicine, control and aerospace, the flexible control is one of the most important research directions in many subjects. The thesis based on the HIWIN linear motor with the flexible beam is to research on the characteristics of flexible systems and control problems. On the one hand, the modeling and modal analysis of the cantilever as well as the linear motor system are adopted to get the approximate two order dynamics equations of the system. On the other hand, the hardware platform is established and the frequency domain characteristics and parameters of the system are obtained. Through the aforementioned two parts, we get the model of the system, and subsequently the simulation and controller design based on the model. In addition，the effect of the controller should be verified, and the modeling, analysis, identification, simulation and control of the system are completed, which provides an engineering example for the study of the flexible systems."
