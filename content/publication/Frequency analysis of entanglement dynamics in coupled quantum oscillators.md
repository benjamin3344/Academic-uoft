abstract = "We study harmonic oscillators connected by periodic or quasi-periodic couplings in a common heat bath. Driving frequencies of couplings play an important role in sustaining entanglement among the oscillators, even in high temperature. Driving amplitudes and relative driving frequencies determine whether entanglement would occur, while the base frequency determines characteristic parameters of entanglement dynamics. Frequency properties of ripples in logarithmic entropy are investigated by FFT, in cases with multiple coupling terms. Finally, frequency landscape is given for controlling entanglement dynamics."
