title: Evernote to Org-mode
---

I've been meaning to get everything off of evernote for some time now.
I've never really liked their service. It always seemed sluggish and
the UI/UX wasn't great. This week, Evernote announced some limitations
on free accounts that make it mostly useless now.

So I decided to get my data out of there and into
[org-mode](http://orgmode.org/) I didn't have much, really, anyway -
mostly recipes. It was over 100 different notes, though, so manually
copy/pasting was out of the question.

Although I focused on converting to org mode, you could use this to
convert evernote notes to anything [pandoc](http://pandoc.org/)
supports - markdown, libre office, microsoft word, and others.

The process wasn't perfect - there was some formatting mistakes that
pandoc made. But it overally went really smoothly. And now I have all
my recipes in org-mode! 


Turns out that it's relatively straightfoward to do. I wrote up brief
instructions on how to do so in a github gist:
