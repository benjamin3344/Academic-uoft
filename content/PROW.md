abstract = "Through the three stages of the development of robot- teach and playback robot, the robot with sensors, and the intelligent robot-we come to the generation that industrial robots are widely produced and utilized in our industrial manufacture. Its applications expands everywhere. In the meanwhile. The robots for entertainment and service appear and the amount is increasing rapidly. The first part of the paper is a general introduction of the development of robotics, especially industrial robots. The second part aims to introduce the fundamentals of robotics with some examples based on our manipulator PROW. A painting entertainment robot PROW (painting robot on web) is designed preliminarily with some basic theoretical research and experimental verification have been carried out on the serial robot with four degrees of freedom."
